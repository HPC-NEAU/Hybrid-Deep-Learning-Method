# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Method
In this work, a hybrid deep learning method combined deep residual network, dense network , and deep convolution generative adversarial network was proposed for plant disease identification in this study, the novel method took advantage of the three models and achieved satisfactory results under imbalanced dataset to address the low identification accuracy under an imbalanced training data. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 0.9774 F1-score and 0.9781 testing accuracy, outperform the other models. Furthermore, we had designed a point-to-point recognition system based on the proposed method in smartphone
